This Warthunder repo contains the cache files used for almost all datamineable contents. 

The Live branch will be updated in a weekly cycle
OR if there was a major update to the branch at the xx.xx.xx.-- position (such as 2.5.0.3 -> 2.5.0.12 will be ignored, but 2.5.3.1 -> 2.6.1.1 will be updated).

The Dev branch will be updated if a major patch is anticipated.
Additional updates to the Repo are of course always possible. 

For any questions/suggestions/etc. you can reach me under 
FlareFloðŸ¦†#2800 -Discord
